# Base project for the training

React Testing Library is a library built on DOM Testing Library to provide support for React component testing. DOM Testing Library is a light-weight solution to write maintainable tests for UI applications. The main idea behind this library is to focus on the actual functionality behind a given application, so that the tests are more concerned with that the application does and what the user sees rather than implementation details and the abstractions behind them. This approach also favors maintainability in the long term, as the tests themselves should not break when refactoring or performing implementation changes as long as the same outwards functionality is kept.

This repository covers some guided examples to introduce briefly React Testing Library and React Hooks Testing Library to write tests using Jest. For further examples, you may check some of the resources below
